Tasks that everyone has to do:
-read the two papers and write down questions to discuss (any question is very important)
-understand the relation between c_t (value of ambiguity set) and K_t (kalman gain)

Sasa obradovic:
-translation of Zorzi's code

Tommaso tubaldo:
-understand kalmannet code and see what can be reused for our purpose


Riccardo Zattra:
-understand kalmannet code and see what can be reused for our purpose


Question to be answered:
1) Is Extended_sysmdl.py the library to be used to implemente the synthetic NL model? (For me (ricky) it seems this one)
2) How are we going to generate data from the NL model? (I think (ricky) there are functions in Extended_sysmdl.py)
3) Relation between the C_t and K_t kalman gain
4) line 54 file parameters.py of folder lorenz attractor what is " ### Auxiliar MultiDimensional Tensor B and C (they make A --> Differential equation matrix)"?
5) check line 114 file main_lor_DT.py what the variable sys_model_pass2 does?

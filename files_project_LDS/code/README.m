% This file pertains to the REKF, where you are required to implement the following functions:
% func_f.m, func_fl.m, func_h.m, and func_hl.m, based on the state-space model.
% Specifically:
% - func_f.m and func_h.m correspond to the $f$ and $h$ functions in the model.
% - func_fl.m and func_hl.m implement the linearized versions of $f$ and $h$ 
%   using their Jacobians with respect to $\hat x_{t|t}$ and $\hat x_t$.
